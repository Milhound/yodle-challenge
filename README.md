# Yodle Challenge
##### My scratch work design to beating the Greedy Algorithm for the denominations of 1, 4, 5, and 9. For Yodleâ€™s challenge.
  
This is program consists of my ideology on how to beat the Greedy Algorithm for Yodle's Challenge. This code is not optimized for speed/length/reusability.
 The code is written using repeating methods and should be avoided if ever used in a real world application. I simply wanted to solve the problem 
 as quickly as possible, and document my endeavors. Please let me know if you have a better method of solving this. I by no means am declaring this
 as the correct answer to Yodle's challenge, just my findings.
